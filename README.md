XWidgets Examples
=================

Due to the inconsistent behaviour of major browsers in regards to loading local file resources
via XMLHttpRequest, if you wish to run the examples locally (as in, straight from the file system) it is 
recommended that you use Firefox.  If Firefox reports a security error when opening the examples, 
then please refer to note (1) below.

Alternatively you may host the XWidgets distribution in a web server environment, in which case
all examples should work in all browsers without any additional configuration required.

Example Name      Description
=================================================================================================

panels            Demonstrates the panel layout capabilities.



=================================================================================================

(1) Because of Firefox's restrictive default settings, you may receive a security 
error when trying to load the examples.  To get around this, you need to modify
Firefox's configuration by following these steps:

* type about:config in the address bar
* Find the setting security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy and change it to false.
